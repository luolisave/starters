Welcome to Li's Project Starters!
===================

This repository contain an collection of Javascript project starters.

Goal
--------------
The goal of create this repository is make start of an project as quick and simple as possible. Due to the fact that not every project need complicated build, dist and unit test script, I decide to create starters in different level to suite different requirement.

Folder Structure
---------------
- First Level folder will always represent the framework library.
- Second Level folder will represent **Starter Level**.
- Inside Starter Level (eg. react/L1/) are acture starters.

- eL1 - embeded L0. cdn only, with ui-route, no need of nodejs and npm.  This is for rapid deploy.
